Concept:
  A year round seasonal game where users form teams and compete in a car scavenger hunt within a preset time span.

Research: 
  Most scavenger hunt apps cost and are expensive. Also this can be used as team building activities or social engagement activity.

Current Features:
*  Login with Firebase Authentication
*  Randomly generated code to link to your game
*  Upload or Take a Photo Functions
*  Display game scores and final scores with winner

Features in Development:
*  Challenge button to each picture
*  Points system for each picture
*  Change scavenger hunt based on time of year
*  Apple Pay - each player contributes $20 and final winner wins the pot
